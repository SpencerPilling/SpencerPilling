            <h2 class="content_about_header">A little bit about me</h2>
            <p class="content_about_paragraph">I have worked in the mining industry as a heavy duty machinery operator / supervisor for the the past 15 years. A year ago I made the decision to start looking into changing careers, specifically getting into the tech industry. I have always been into computer technology since a very early age. When I was 5 years old, my grandfather brought home a Commodore 64 for us to play on, from then on I was hooked.</p>
            
            <p class="content_about_paragraph">When I was 13 I finally got my very own PC, Pentium 75! After being frustrated with windows 95, I decided to install Slackware Linux because my friend had told me that is what Hackers used as their operating systems. Did I mention that I had watched the movie "Hackers" about 50 times by then? In the early 90's the internet was like the wild wild west, and for a 15 year old running Linux, I had a lot of fun acquiring free internet dial up for years. I was also volunteering with a group of college kids building websites for a start-up company back then.</p> 
            
            <p class="content_about_paragraph">As time passed, I grew up and graduated High school and it was time to find a job to support myself. I started in sales then labouring as it paid more. At age 21, I had found myself working in the mining industry, traveling around the province building roads with a great company that I stayed with for 13 years. Which brings us to my current situation. I am still in the mining industry, working full time for a smaller company which has given me the flexibility to start learning about the tech industry once again.</p>
            
            <p class="content_about_paragraph">Overtime, I have played around with web development so I thought that would be a good place to start this journey. I am currently enrolled with Freecodecamp.org, brushing up on my HTML and CSS, a lot sure has changed over the years and I am excited to start coding again.</p>
